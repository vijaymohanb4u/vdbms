Based on my exploration of the project, I can now provide you with a comprehensive understanding of what this project does:

## Project Overview: VDBMS (Vector Database Management System)

This project is a **SQL-to-JSON Database Engine** that provides a complete SQL interface for JSON-based database operations. It's essentially a lightweight, file-based database management system that allows you to use familiar SQL syntax to work with JSON files as if they were database tables.

## Key Components

### 1. **JSON CRUD Operations** (`json_crud.py`)
- Provides basic Create, Read, Update, Delete operations on JSON files
- Treats JSON files as database tables with automatic ID generation
- Includes timestamp tracking (`created_at`, `updated_at`)
- Supports filtering and querying operations
- Configuration-based file management (stores files in `db/` directory by default)

### 2. **SQL Parser** (`sql_parser.py`)
- Built using PLY (Python Lex-Yacc) for parsing SQL statements
- Supports standard SQL operations: `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- Generates Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) for parsed SQL
- Handles complex WHERE clauses with logical operators (`AND`, `OR`) and pattern matching (`LIKE`)
- Supports various data types and constraints (`PRIMARY KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `NOT NULL`, `AUTO_INCREMENT`)

### 3. **SQL-JSON Integration Engine** (`sql_json_engine.py`)
- **Main component** that bridges SQL parsing with JSON operations
- Executes SQL statements on JSON files
- Maintains a schema registry (`_schemas.json`) for table definitions
- Validates data against defined constraints
- Provides both programmatic API and interactive console

### 4. **Configuration Management** (`config.py`)
- Centralized configuration via `settings.json`
- Configurable database directory, file extensions, formatting options
- Supports pretty-printing JSON for readability

## What It Does

### **Core Functionality:**
1. **Create Tables**: Define table schemas with columns, data types, and constraints
2. **Insert Data**: Add records with automatic validation against schema constraints
3. **Query Data**: Use SQL SELECT statements with WHERE clauses, pattern matching, and logical operators
4. **Update Records**: Modify existing data with constraint validation
5. **Delete Records**: Remove data based on conditions
6. **Schema Management**: Persistent table schemas with constraint enforcement

### **Key Features:**
- **SQL Interface**: Write standard SQL queries that execute on JSON files
- **Schema Validation**: Enforces PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL constraints
- **Pattern Matching**: Supports LIKE operator with wildcards
- **Complex Queries**: AND/OR logic with parentheses grouping
- **Interactive Console**: Command-line interface for executing SQL statements
- **File-based Storage**: All data stored as human-readable JSON files
- **Automatic Timestamps**: Tracks creation and modification times

## Use Cases

This system is perfect for:
- **Prototyping**: Quick database setup without installing a full RDBMS
- **Small Applications**: Projects that need structured data but don't require high-performance databases
- **Educational Projects**: Learning SQL concepts with visible, editable JSON files
- **Configuration Storage**: Structured configuration data with SQL query capabilities
- **Development/Testing**: Local development where you want to see and edit data files directly
- **Lightweight Applications**: When a full database server is overkill

## Example Usage

```sql
-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    age INT
);

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO users (name, email, age) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com', 30);

-- Query data
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 25 AND email LIKE '%@example.com';

-- Update records
UPDATE users SET age = 31 WHERE name = 'John Doe';

-- Delete records
DELETE FROM users WHERE age < 18;
```

The project essentially provides a **lightweight, SQL-compatible database** that stores everything in JSON files, making it perfect for scenarios where you want the convenience of SQL with the simplicity and transparency of file-based storage.

_**User**_

update the main README.md accordingly

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the main README.md to better reflect the complete project scope, including the SQL-to-JSON database engine capabilities. Let me read the current README first to understand what needs to be updated.

---

Read file: README.md

Now I'll create a completely updated README.md that reflects the full project scope:
